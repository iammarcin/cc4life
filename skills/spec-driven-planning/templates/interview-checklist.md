# Interview Checklist

Use this as a guide during the discovery interview. Don't read questions from this list verbatim -- adapt them to the conversation. The goal is understanding, not form completion.

---

## Round 1: Problem and Context

**Mandatory (ask these first, every time):**

- [ ] What decision does this research inform? What will you DO differently when you have it?
- [ ] What triggered this now? (Something changed, or proactive?)
- [ ] What do you already know? (Starting point -- don't duplicate existing knowledge)

**If they describe a topic instead of a problem:**
- [ ] "You said research X. What's the question about X you need answered?"
- [ ] "If the research tells you [obvious thing about X], is that useful? Or do you need something more specific?"

**If they describe a solution instead of a problem:**
- [ ] "That structure sounds solid. Before we lock it in -- what problem are we solving? The right approach falls out of the problem definition."

---

## Round 2: Scope and Constraints

**Boundaries:**
- [ ] How deep vs. how broad? (One topic thoroughly or many topics surveyed?)
- [ ] What's explicitly out of scope? (Name 2-3 things you do NOT need)
- [ ] Time boundary? (Last 6 months, current state only, forward-looking?)
- [ ] Geographic scope? (Global, European, specific country?)

**Resources and constraints:**
- [ ] Source preferences? (Academic, industry reports, social media, primary data?)
- [ ] Are there things you've already tried that didn't work?
- [ ] Budget/time constraints on the research itself?
- [ ] Access limitations? (No paid databases, no behind-paywall sources?)

---

## Round 3: Output and Success

**Deliverable:**
- [ ] What format works? (Structured report, executive brief, comparison matrix, talking points?)
- [ ] Who reads this besides you? (Audience shapes depth and language)
- [ ] What's the single most important output? (If you could only get one thing...)
- [ ] What would make this research worthless? (The anti-requirement)

**Success criteria:**
- [ ] How will you know this research is done?
- [ ] What's the minimum that would be useful? (The "good enough" bar)
- [ ] What's the stretch goal? (If the research goes perfectly)

---

## Round 4: Gap Filling (If Needed)

Only ask these if Rounds 1-3 left gaps. Don't ask for the sake of asking.

**Competitor/market research specifics:**
- [ ] Who are the top competitors? (Or should we identify them?)
- [ ] What dimensions matter? (Pricing? Features? Team? Funding? Tech?)
- [ ] Do you need a recommendation or just the data?

**Prospect research specifics:**
- [ ] What are you selling? (One sentence)
- [ ] Who's the meeting with? (Role, context)
- [ ] What objection are you trying to pre-empt?
- [ ] What deal size? (Determines research depth)

**Content/marketing specifics:**
- [ ] What channels are you active on?
- [ ] Is there an existing brand voice to match?
- [ ] What's the first piece of content you'd create from this?

**Technical research specifics:**
- [ ] What's the current stack? (Constraints)
- [ ] What are the non-negotiables?
- [ ] Who makes the final decision?

---

## Readiness Check

Before writing the spec, verify you can answer:

- [ ] **Problem:** Can I state the problem in one sentence without guessing?
- [ ] **Decision:** Do I know what decision this informs?
- [ ] **Scope:** Can I name 3 things that are IN and 3 that are OUT?
- [ ] **Done:** Can I write success criteria that are binary (met / not met)?
- [ ] **Format:** Do I know what the deliverable looks like?
- [ ] **Audience:** Do I know who reads this and what they need from it?

If any answer is "no" -- ask another question. Don't guess.

## Interview Signals

**Good signs (you're getting real requirements):**
- User gives long, detailed answers about specific aspects
- User corrects your assumptions ("No, not that -- more like...")
- User mentions failed previous attempts
- User names specific people or decisions
- User pushes back on your scope suggestions

**Warning signs (you're getting surface answers):**
- Every answer is "yes, that too" (scope creep)
- User defers to you on everything ("whatever you think")
- Answers are all abstract, no concrete examples
- User seems impatient with questions ("just start researching")

**For impatient users:** Acknowledge the urgency, then ask the minimum viable questions: "I'll be fast -- three questions so this research actually hits the mark. What decision does this inform? What's the single most important thing to find? What would make the output useless?" That's 30 seconds of questions that save hours of misguided research.
